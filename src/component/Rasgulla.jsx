Boil a sugar syrup made of water and sugar, and gently drop the chenna balls into the boiling syrup. Let them cook for about 15-20 minutes until they expand and soak in the syrup. Once done, cool the Rasgullas and refrigerate them for a few hours. Serve chilled, garnished with saffron strands or pistachio slivers for added flavor.";
